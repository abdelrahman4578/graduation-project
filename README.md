# Pneumonia Diagnosis System using Deep Learning
## Introduction
Pneumonia is a common lung disease caused by bacterial infections, and early diagnosis plays a crucial role in ensuring successful treatment. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have shown promise in accurately diagnosing and classifying various types of pneumonia. This project aims to develop a medical diagnosis system that leverages deep learning algorithms to classify pneumonia cases and identify the specific type of pneumonia based on chest X-ray images.

## Project Overview
### Objective
The primary goal of this project is to create a robust and efficient medical diagnosis system capable of:

Determining whether a patient has pneumonia.
Identifying the type of pneumonia (e.g., bacterial, viral, or COVID-19-related).
Methodology
To achieve our objectives, we will utilize state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to analyze chest X-ray images. The system will extract relevant features from these images, allowing for accurate classification.

## Dataset
Our system will be trained on a large and diverse dataset of chest X-ray images. This dataset will be meticulously labeled by medical experts and will include the following categories:

Normal X-ray images (healthy individuals).
Pneumonia X-ray images (bacterial and viral pneumonia cases).
COVID-19-related X-ray images (cases associated with COVID-19 infection).
## Features
Accurate pneumonia diagnosis using deep learning techniques.
Identification of pneumonia type for precise treatment.
Utilization of a large and expert-labeled dataset for training.
Accessibility through a user-friendly website.
Simple and intuitive user interface suitable for both medical professionals and patients.
## Usage
Our system will be accessible through a dedicated website, ensuring easy access for doctors and patients. The website's user-friendly interface will provide a seamless and excellent user experience, making it straightforward to upload and analyze chest X-ray images.

## Getting Started
To get started with our system, please follow these steps:

Visit our website (URL will be provided).
Upload the chest X-ray image you want to analyze.
Wait for the system to process the image and provide a diagnosis and pneumonia type, if applicable.
